## Chapter Goals

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to:

-   Understand what open materials are and why they matter in psycholinguistics.
-   Locate and adapt existing open psycholinguistic tasks.
-   Build and share your own experiment using open tools.

## 1. Why Use Open Materials in Psycholinguistics?

Psycholinguistics relies on standard tasks like lexical decision, priming, and self-paced reading. These tasks are ideal for open science because they are replicable, easy to remix, and powerful for comparative research.

Benefits of open materials:

-   Transparency and reproducibility
-   Accessibility for students and low-resource institutions
-   Easier collaboration and adaptation

## 2. Where to Find and Run Open Psycholinguistic Tasks

| Platform | What It’s Good For | Open Access? | Coding Skill? | Host Online? |
|------------|--------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| PsyToolkit | Reaction time tasks, LDT, Stroop, Simon | Yes | Moderate | Yes |
| IRIS Database | Downloadable SLA/psycholinguistic materials | Yes | None | No |
| OSF | Sharing complete experiments & preprints | Yes | None | Depends |
| PCIbex | Browser-based psycholinguistic tasks | Yes | Some | Yes |
| Gorilla.sc | Drag-and-drop experiment design | Partially | Low | Yes |

Tip: If you’re comfortable with basic scripting, PsyToolkit is an excellent place to start.

## 3. Adapting a Task for L2 Research

You don’t need to start from scratch. Begin with existing materials and tweak them for your goals.

### Example: Metonymy in Self-Paced Reading

Research Question: Do L2 English learners process sentences with metonymic expressions more slowly than literal sentences?

Why this works:

-   Metonymy involves contextual meaning
-   Self-paced reading lets us observe word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase comprehension

### Segment Format (Phrase-based)

We use phrase-by-phrase presentation to preserve figurative meaning:

Metonymy example:

-   The press / criticized the decision / sharply.
-   The bench / voted against the proposal / yesterday.

Control example:

-   Emma / went shopping for groceries.

-   David / painted his bedroom walls / blue.

## 4. Build an Open Experiment: Step-by-Step with PsyToolkit

Let’s walk through an experiment from start to finish.

### Research Question:

Do L2 learners experience slower reading times for metonymic expressions?

### Steps:

1.  Go to <https://www.psytoolkit.org> and log in
2.  Choose a template: Self-paced reading or Lexical Decision
3.  Click “Use this experiment”
4.  Replace stimulus text: Insert your metonymy and control sentences
5.  Set segment display: Choose phrase-by-phrase for metonymy
6.  Test and deploy: Use PsyToolkit’s online hosting feature
7.  Export and analyze data: Download reaction times and compare groups

Example stimulus list (randomized):

1.  Tom played football in the park. He scored two goals yesterday.
2.  The ship sailed into the harbor at dawn. The crew prepared for unloading.
3.  Sarah read a fascinating book. She finished it in two days.
4.  The bench voted against the proposal yesterday. Lawyers discussed the case.
5.  David painted his bedroom walls blue. It looks fresh and clean.
6.  The studio released a new movie this month. Audiences gave mixed reviews.
7.  Emma went shopping for groceries. She bought apples and oranges.
8.  The press criticized the decision sharply. Many readers were surprised.
9.  Lisa baked a chocolate cake. Her friends loved the dessert.
10. The track hosted several exciting races last weekend. Fans cheered loudly.

## 5. Build an Open Experiment: Step-by-Step with Gorilla

## 5. Reflect and Review

Evaluation and thoughts

### Reflection Activity:

Which tool would you choose for your first experiment?

-   GUI interface (no coding) → Gorilla.sc
-   Templates plus online hosting → PsyToolkit
-   Full scripting control → PCIbex

### Mini Quiz:

Q: Which of the following tools allow you to host experiments online? (Choose all that apply)

-   [ ] IRIS Database
-   [x] PsyToolkit
-   [x] Gorilla.sc
-   [x] PCIbex
-   [ ] SPSS

## Bonus 

### 3 PsyToolkit Experiments You Can Try Today

1.  Lexical Decision Task Purpose: Measure how fast participants recognize real words Customize: Replace words with L2 vocabulary or morphologically complex items

2.  Stroop Task Purpose: Explore cognitive interference with bilingual participants Customize: Add bilingual stimuli or adjust congruency pairs

3.  Simon Task Purpose: Study spatial attention and control Customize: Use language-relevant keys or visual categories
