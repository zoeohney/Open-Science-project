Open Science textbook project draft:

Designing and Using Open Experiments in Psycholinguistics and Applied Linguistics: A Student‚Äôs Guide. 
This chapter will teach new researchers (B.A., M.A., Ph.D. students in linguistics or language teaching) how to:
1.	Understand why open materials are crucial in psycholinguistics.
2.	Find, adapt, and document open tests/stimuli (lexical decision tasks, priming tasks, self-paced reading, eye-tracking, etc.).
3.	Build simple experiments using open-source tools (e.g., PsychoPy, OSF, Gorilla, PCIbex).
4.	Contribute back to the open science ecosystem.
Why Use Open Materials in Psycholinguistics? 
‚Ä¢	The replication crisis in psychology and how open science helps.
‚Ä¢	Benefits: reliability, reuse, scalability.
‚Ä¢	Psycholinguistic experiments rely on standard tasks (e.g., lexical decision, priming, eye-tracking).
‚Ä¢	Example: Why using a validated open Cloze or lexical decision test gives better comparability across studies.
Where to Find and Run Open Psycholinguistic Tasks
Platform	What It‚Äôs Good For	Open Access?	Coding Skill Needed?	Host Online?
PsyToolkit	Reaction time tasks, Stroop, lexical decision tasks	‚úÖ Yes	üü° Moderate (simple scripts)	‚úÖ Yes
IRIS Database	SLA + psycholinguistics task materials (stimuli, tests)	‚úÖ Yes	‚ö™ None (PDFs & docs)	‚ùå No
OSF	Hosting full experiments & preprints	‚úÖ Yes	‚ö™ None	‚ö™ Depends
PCIbex	Browser-based experiments (priming, self-paced reading)	‚úÖ Yes	üü° Some	‚úÖ Yes
Gorilla.sc	GUI-based experiment builder (click + drag)	‚ö†Ô∏è Some Free	üü¢ Low (GUI)	‚úÖ Yes

How to Adapt a Test Battery or Task
You don‚Äôt have to build from scratch! Start from existing materials and adapt them to your research question.
Example 1: Lexical Decision Task (LDT)
‚Ä¢	Original: Word/nonword decisions for English monolinguals
‚Ä¢	Adaptation: Use L2 vocabulary for beginner/intermediate learners
Example 2: Priming Task
‚Ä¢	Change semantic relatedness or time window between prime and target (SOA)
Example 3: Self-Paced Reading
‚Ä¢	Adjust sentence length or complexity for proficiency level
Mini Activity:
Q: You want to study L2 verb agreement errors. Which task is most appropriate?
A: Grammaticality Judgment Task (GJT)
B:  Stroop Task

Build an Open Experiment Step-by-Step
Let‚Äôs walk through an example.
Research Question:
Do L2 learners process idioms more slowly under time pressure?
Steps:
1.	Find a task: Self-Paced Reading or Lexical Decision
2.	Get open stimuli: e.g., from IRIS or OSF
3.	Edit stimuli: CSV or plain text format
4.	Build it: Use PsyToolkit or PCIbex
5.	Share it: Upload to OSF or GitHub with a README and license

Detailed Example: Self-Paced Reading Task in PsyToolkit
Getting Started:
1.	Go to https://www.psytoolkit.org and log in
1.	You can create a free account and save your experiments, questionnaires etc. in your account. 
2.	Choose the Self-Paced Reading Task template from the experiment library
3.	Click ‚ÄúUse this experiment‚Äù better: download the zip file. 
4.	Open and edit the sentence table 
5.	Save, run, and test the experiment
6.	Export data and upload to OSF
7.	Analysis and plots can be done on psytoolkit as well! 

Detailed Example:

Reflection Activity
Which platform fits your style?
‚Ä¢	Prefer GUI? ‚Üí Try Gorilla.sc
‚Ä¢	Want templates? ‚Üí Use PsyToolkit
‚Ä¢	Want full coding control? ‚Üí Go with PCIbex

Lexical Decision Task (LDT)
Purpose: Measure reaction times to words vs. nonwords
Skills: Editing stimulus lists, analyzing RT data
Steps:
‚Ä¢	Use the PsyToolkit LDT template
‚Ä¢	Replace English words with your own vocabulary set
‚Ä¢	Preview and run your experiment in the browser
Stroop Task
Purpose: Explore cognitive interference and attention
Skills: Understanding congruency effects
Steps:
‚Ä¢	Choose the Stroop template
‚Ä¢	Edit color-word pairings
‚Ä¢	Add L2 language options if needed
